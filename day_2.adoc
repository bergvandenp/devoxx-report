== Java EE 8: What's New in the Java EE 8 Release
=== David Delabassee
===== Paul
This was an update on some of the new JEE 8 specifications, which was released earlier this year.
A few highlights:
* JAX-RS 2.1: better support for streams and asynchronous processing.
* JAX-RS 2.1: http reactive client with fluent api.
* JAX-RS 2.1: server sent events.
* Servlet 4: HTTP/2 support with server push.
* CDI 2: support for asynchronous events.
* CDI 2: support for event listener ordering.

== gRPC vs REST: let the battle begin!
=== Alex Borysov & Mykyta Protsenko
===== Paul
gRPC is a new mechanism (devloped by Google) to communicate between services, that can be implemented as an alternative for using REST api's over HTTP.
In this talk several scenario's were discussed using gRPC or REST over HTTP.
gRPC is built with performance being a top priority.
Performance is more important than usability, which can be considered a characteristic of REST.
The use of formal (IDL) contracts with protocol buffers is mandatory.
It supports a variety of languages and tools can create stub code based on the contracts.

== The Diabolical Developer's Guide to Perfomance Tuning
=== Martijn Verburg
===== Paul
Martijn Verburg runs a company (together with Kirk Pepperdine) called jClarity.
jClarity is specialised in analysing and solving performance problems.
They work with a simple method to give guidance about where to look for the problem.
A problem can occur at multiple levels: Operating system (including virtualisation), jvm, application.
He gave some pointers on where to start your investigation and how tools can help  with that.
It's very important to *measure* what the problem is, instead of guessing and maybe fixing something that is not the actual problem at hand.

== Using Kotlin to implement Clean Architecture
=== Lieven Doclo
===== Paul
This talk was divided in 2 parts: A brief description of Clean Architecture ("invented by Robert C. Martin") and a live demo using Kotlin.
In Clean Architecture it's very important to have several layers (like an union) that communicate with each other in only one direction.
A layer can only communicate with it's direct neighbour.
To make this possible we need to create different models in various layers.
For instance: The outer presentation layer doesn't "know" domain objects, but communicates using presentation objects.
Kotlin is pretty handy to create those different objects with a feature that is called "extension methods".


== The Java Council
=== Simon Maple, Martijn Verburg, Oleg Å elajev
*Time for beer!*
The Java Council is a podcast about Java.
This was an entertaining session.
First they showed the results of a survey that Zeroturnaround held across developers and made a couple of jokes, of course.
They also invented JDuchess to the floor which is celebrating it's 10 years anniversary.
JDuchess is a JUG (Java User Group) founded in The Netherlands.
The goal of this JUG is to support women in the software development industry.
Brian Goetz and Mark Reinhold were also invited on stage to answer some light developer questions.

== Highway to Elm
=== Jordane Grenat
===== Paul
We got an introduction to yet another programming language, called "Elm".
Elm "compiles" to javascript and therefore works on every major browser.
It's a typed language and it's killer feature is *No runtime exceptions*.
Error message during compilation / development are very clear and also come with suggestions about how to fix the problem.
The session was divided in two parts: explanation of the syntax / operations and a live coding demo.
A language worth looking into I would say.

== Opening Up Java EE: Panel Discussion
===  David Delabassee, Mike Croft, Dimitris Andreadis, Ivar Grimstad, Martijn Verburg, Roberto Cortez, Steve Poole
===== Paul
This was a very interesting panel discussion.
JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) is in the process of being moved from Oracle to The Eclipse Foundation.
That means that Oracle no longer decides about the future of JEE, but the community is.
No one knows were this will lead to yet, but it's struggling with a bad reputation now.
Hopefully this change will boost the community to create an even better platform.

== The Rise of the Weaponized AI Propaganda Machine
=== Berit Anderson
