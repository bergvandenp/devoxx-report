== Keynote: Moving java faster
=== Mark Reinhold

===== Paul
Chief Architect for the JDK (Java Development Kit) Mark Reinhold told us a bit about the new Java9 release, which came out last September.
Mostly this talk was about the future after java9.
Particularly release dates and versioning.
From now on a new version of Java SE (Standard edition) will be released every 6 months.
Up until now releases were postponed until big features were ready to ship.
Now the release will take place and will contain what's done at that moment.
The next release (in march) will be version 10, the next 11 and so on.
He proposed a version syntax like ours (year.month), but that proposal didn't make it.

===== Hendrik
Java is going to have two releases per year. Most probably the next release will be 10, in March 2018. Followed by 11 in September. The 11 release will be so-called long term support (LTS) release, that will be supported for (at least) 3 years.
Jigsaw (Java 9 modules) does not do versioning. Versioning is something you do at the jar-level, and is already done perfectly fine by tools like Maven and Gradle. "That's a solved problem", to quote Mark.
Apparently the joke's old, but I had not seen it before: Oracle's chief Java architect, clicking away the legal notice, muttering: "don't believe a word I've said". haha.

== Keynote: Cern from an IT perspective
==== Derek Mathieson

===== Paul
Someone from Cern told us what Cern is all about.
What the area roughly looks like, how the world famous particle accelerator works and which parts are developed using Java.
===== Hendrik
Mind blowing presentation about cathedral-sized particle scanners and server rooms that process huge amounts of data. Java is at the heart of it.
CERN is a very open organization that welcomes visitors. 4500 tours are done each year!

== Keynote: Move slow and Mend Things
=== Kevlin Henney
video::1kklyq4XYpw[youtube]
===== Paul

This was a really good talk about what developers do and what the consequences are of those actions.
When working with a method like Scrum there's a notion of velocity.
Velocity is *not* the same thing as speed.
Going fast is not the thing to strive for and can harm the quality of a product.
Often shortcuts will be taken to reach the goal of a sprint.

===== Hendrik
Kevlin Henney gave a talk about a couple of misconceptions with respect to Agile development and velocity. One of the best the remarks is, that is very bad to go at a very high speed into the wrong direction. It is better to slow down and steadily go in the right direction. Sometimes it can be good thing to "Go Fast and Break Things", as Facebook is stating, but in most situations, the very opposite is true.
Kevin is a good speaker, that has good quotes, of which quite a few from himself :-)

== Kotlin for Java Programmers
=== Venkat Subramaniam
video::7EVXypZDOos[youtube]

===== Paul
The first parallel session I picked was about Kotlin.
Venkat brought us up-to-speed with the most interesting features that this new programming language offers.
It's a language that compiles to jvm byte code and it took the best parts from languages like Java, Groovy, Scala and Swift.
With Venkat presenting we had to keep focussed, because he tells A LOT in a short amount of time.
I like his style though.

===== Hendrik
Speaking in front of a large audience is very difficult, but speaking at the rate of Venkat adds another dimension. The concepts of Kotlin where not new to me, so I could follow along, but clicking through some tutorial on the internet may be better. Venkat is quite funny, though.

== Modular Development with JDK 9
=== Alex Buckley
video::rfOjch4p0Po[youtube]

===== Paul
This was a deep dive into how to use java9 modules.
With modules we can create clear boundaries between api's that we want to expose and code that may only be used by the module itself.
With a `module-info.java` you can define which classes / packages to export and what the dependencies of the module are.
A system can be moved to modules step-by-step, so no big bang implementation is required.
The usage of classes between modules are checked by the compiler AND the runtime jvm.
The jvm can operate a lot faster, because class resolution becomes a lot easier with a module dependency tree.

== Get silly with serverless: a fun introduction to the newest way to run your code
==== Guillaume Laforge && Bret McGowen (Google employees)
video::7NjRqMYH11s[youtube]

===== Hendrik
Before this talk I was not sure what serverless actually was, so I was curious. Basically serverless boils down to: not having to worry about scalability, load balancing, OS updates and things like that. That is handed by the platform (Google Cloud, in this case). The new concept Google introduces is "Function as a Service" (FaaS). Your Faas code, is billed at sub-second rates, so when your function is not running, you are not being billed for that time. This is different from other Google services, like e.g. storage. This opens up a lot of possibilities. You can very easily deploy your Node.js code (Java is coming later).
So, based on this talk, I'm convinced that serverless is good for quick proof of concepts, but once you go to production, servers are more cost effective.


== Plain Functional Programming
==== Martin Odersky
video::YXDm3WHZT5g[youtube]

===== Paul
Martin Odersky is the man behind Scala (programming language which compiles to jvm byte code).
He told us about functional programming in general in what common pitfalls are.
He also gave a demo about some new features that Scala 3 brings to the table.
One of those features is *implicit parameters*, which automatically passes parameters in methods as needed.

===== Hendrik
The title of this presentation is somewhat misleading. You'd expect some basic stuff, instead he went into the deep quite fast, touching Monads and the concept of Kleisli's. In Scala 3.0 Kleisli's are possible with the new `implicit` keyword. What it boils down to, is that for code where you have to pass a large number of arguments, that propagate through the rest of the code, you can solve this by adding the `implicit` keyword. The variables are automatically available to rest of the code. Note that the compiler does not solve this creating a global variable, or something like that. Powerful stuff.

== Modules in One Lesson
==== Mark Reinhold
video::rFhhLXcOBsk[youtube]

===== Hendrik
I think it's very cool that Oracle's chief architect, takes the time to explain how Java 9 modules work (at a nice pace). It's not very complicated. Java 9 modules offer you far more control over access to code that you want keep private, in some part of your code. You must be explicit in `exports` and `requires`. Both are checked at both compile time and run time.

== Documentation as Code (explained to my dad)
==== Hubert Sablonni√®re
video::ggBv_pZDu0c[youtube]

===== Paul
A talk about documentation.
A nice story about his own dad writing medical articles using various tools and collaborating with his editor.
He made a case for using ascii-doc.
Ascii-doc documents are just plain text files (comparable to markdown) with very easy-to-use, but rich markup symbols.
Custom labels can be used to create a set of rules that everyone involved with the document(s) uses.
For instance: the writer, the editor and the publisher agree on a tag to indicate information boxes in a book.
With asciidoctor you can create various types of output (pdf, html, etc) automatically.
We already use it to document various Glue modules and I'm using it now to write this report.

== 10 tips to become an awesome Technical Lead
==== Bart Blommaerts
video::yhtK1jQC_4s[youtube]

===== Paul
The last talk of the day.
This talk was about culture and roles within a organisation.
We got an overview of what the roles / activities of a technical lead are.
With every role description came some tips on what to pay attention on.
A few examples:

* create a diverse team, with minds that think differently.
* create a comfortable environment for an interviewee during an interview.
* Try to aim for consensus during discussions, but make firm decisions when consensus cannot be achieved.
* Talk to customers

===== Hendrik
What exactly is a tech lead? In Bart's world it is someone who is "up for the job". A tech lead is not some kind of manager, that's my conclusion based on his statement: "make sure you stay technical". But it makes you wonder...
